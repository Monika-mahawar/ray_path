This notebook performs ray tracing simulations using the `optiland` library and then applies machine learning models (Random Forest and Logistic Regression) to analyze the ray tracing data.  The primary goal is to predict the success of a ray reaching the image plane based on its initial properties.

## Setup and Lens Definition

The notebook begins by importing necessary libraries, including `optiland`, `numpy`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`, and scikit-learn modules.  It then defines a specific lens (Heliar Lens f/5 in this case) using the `optiland` library. You can change the lens parameters or use a different lens configuration altogether.

**Key Parameters and Customizable Lens Definitions**

The `HeliarLens` class defines the characteristics of the lens, such as:

* **Surfaces:**  The curvature, thickness, and refractive index of each lens surface are specified.  These parameters are crucial for determining the ray paths and can be modified to study other lens designs.
* **Aperture:** The lens's aperture setting.
* **Field:** The field of view, or angle, for which rays are traced.
* **Wavelengths:** The wavelengths of light considered in the simulation.


## Ray Tracing Simulation

The core of the notebook is the ray tracing simulation.  The `trace_random_rays` function generates a specified number of random rays with varying starting positions and directions. These rays are then traced through the defined lens, and the code records whether each ray successfully reaches the image plane (success = 1) or not (success = 0).  The number of rays can be adjusted to influence the simulation's accuracy and computational cost.


## Data Analysis and Visualization

The generated ray tracing data is then analyzed:

1.  **Data Exploration:** The code provides basic statistics (using the `.describe()` method) and a correlation matrix visualization to understand the relationships between different ray properties and their success.

2.  **Data Preprocessing:**  The data is split into training and testing sets, and SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) is used to address potential class imbalances.  Data scaling is performed using `StandardScaler`.

## Machine Learning Models

Two machine learning models are trained to predict ray success:

1.  **Random Forest:** An ensemble learning method.

2.  **Logistic Regression:** A linear model for binary classification.

The performance of each model is assessed using standard metrics:

*   **Accuracy:** Overall correctness of the prediction.
*   **Classification Report:** Precision, recall, F1-score, and support for each class.
*   **Confusion Matrix:** Visualization of true positive, true negative, false positive, and false negative predictions.
*   **ROC AUC (Receiver Operating Characteristic - Area Under the Curve):** A measure of the model's ability to distinguish between classes.
*   **ROC Curve:** Plots the true positive rate against the false positive rate.
*   **Precision-Recall Curve:** Plots precision against recall.

## Future Improvements

This notebook serves as a starting point for investigating lens design using machine learning.  Some potential avenues for improvement:
* **More Sophisticated Lenses:**  Implement more complex lens models.
* **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Optimize the hyperparameters of the machine learning models.
* **Other ML Models:** Explore other machine learning algorithms.
* **Abberation Analysis:** Analyze different types of abberations in detail using the simulated rays.
